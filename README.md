## Hi there! 👋 
My name Himanshu, <br>
I am a full time CS and Cyber Security student by day, and a freelance video editor, and a night owl coder 🦉. <br>

My skills include:
- HTML, CSS
- Python
- JAVA (learning currently)
- Linux (experience with Ubuntu and Kali Linux)
- Fusion 360
- Figma
- and Video editing!
